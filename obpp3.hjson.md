## Criteria list

ID | Description
--- | ---

OBPPV3/CR02 | Number of clicks required by user to generate a ECDH receiving address (BIP 63 or BIP 47), from the default window/authenticated home page
OBPPV3/CR03 | Non-ECDH receiving addresses are hidden from the default Receive worflow screens once they have been used<br><br> _If the wallet client hides used non-ECDH addresses from view by default but allows the user to expose them in default Receive workflow screens e.g. via an 'Unhide' button, it will fail this criterion_
OBPPV3/CR04 | Preemptively indicates a loss of privacy when user elects to receive funds at a previously-used non-ECDH address, or prohibits this operation entirely<br><br> _This is separate from the scenario in which a user accidentally reuses a non-ECDH receiving address as a result of a failure of criterion OBPPV3/CR03_
OBPPV3/CR05 | Number of clicks required to deviate from the default change functionality and receive change at a newly generated address
OBPPV3/CR06 | Produces P2SH change addresses when one or more of the spend outputs in a transaction is P2SH
OBPPV3/CR07 | Change addresses are hidden from the normal receiving workflow by default to discourage using them as receiving addresses
OBPPV3/CR08 | Preemptively indicates a loss of privacy when user elects to reuse change addresses as receiving addresses, or prohibits this operation entirely<br><br> _A wallet client may pass OBPPV3/CR07 but fail OBPPV3/CR08 by not warning a user when a change address is selected for reuse outside of the normal Receive workflow_
OBPPV3/CR09 | When an outgoing transaction must merge inputs, and when mixing is not being used, the transaction constructed in a way that plausibly resembles a mixing transaction
OBPPV3/CR10 | Inputs and outputs are ordered in a deterministic manner based on criteria other than the status of outputs as spends or change (BIP 69)
OBPPV3/CR11 | Order inputs and outputs via a methodology common to multiple wallets

OBPPV3/CR13 | All transactions created by the wallet are compliant with BIP 62
OBPPV3/CR14 | Allows the user to send to ECDH addresses (BIP 63 or BIP 47)

OBPPV3/CR24 | Number of clicks required by user to configure the client to query blockchain data without leaking his machine's identity over the network<br><br> _Blockchain data that might be queried includes balance information for addresses in the user's wallet. Tor, I2P, and VPNs are valid methods of hiding machine identity_
OBPPV3/CR25 | Blockchain data is obtained from a local copy of the blockchain
OBPPV3/CR26 | Connection contexts are not reused when querying for blockchain data that corresponds to more than one address in a user's wallet<br><br> _A 'connection context' is a persistent network connection to a network peer, such as a Tor identity in Tor Browser used to access a blockchain explorer API, or a TCP connection to another node in the Bitcoin P2P network with a specific origin IP address. The degree to which a new connection context has been created is the degree to which a network observer would find it difficult to correlate new network interactions with prior ones_
OBPPV3/CR27 | Blockchain data is queried via probabilistic filters matching a fraction of Bitcoin addresses with a transaction history beyond the intent of the query<br><br> _Includes filters with a non-zero fraction of false positives, such as prefix or bloom filters_
OBPPV3/CR28 | A single query for blockchain data may corerespond to multiple addresses in a user's wallet, but a separate connection context is used for each query

OBPPV3/CR30 | Number of clicks required by user to route outgoing transactions through an anonymizing network
OBPPV3/CR31 | Outgoing transactions are routed through a different entry point into the network than the source of blockchain data
OBPPV3/CR32 | Client provides a visual indication if outgoing transactions are not being routed through an anonymizing network, including IP address information

OBPPV3/CR35 | The backup process avoids leaking information about wallet addresses<br><br> _One wallet client previously generated e-mail alerts whenever a new change address as a result of sending bitcoin._
OBPPV3/CR36 | Wallet avoids leaking information about recipients via an external identity lookup
OBPPV3/CR37 | The wallet avoids observably connecting to a known endpoint, such as a wallet provider's domain
OBPPV3/CR38 | The wallet connects to the network using an unremarkable user agent
OBPPV3/CR39 | The wallet connects to the network using a random user agent, from a set of unremarkable user agents, for each connection

OBPPV3/CR41 | Program and any dependencies are packaged into a single file which can be easily installed in Tails Live CD
OBPPV3/CR42 | Installation in Tails Live CD is possible, but requires multiple complex steps

OBPPV3/CR74 | The order of transaction outputs is randomized using client-generated data
OBPPV3/CR75 | Inputs are selected such that the amount of change in the transaction is close to the size of the desired spend
OBPPV3/CR76 | Multiple change outputs are created, and at least one of the transaction output values resmebles a plausible spend
OBPPV3/CR77 | Previous transaction outputs and new output values are selected to create multiple possible matching sets between inputs and the user's change outputs
OBPPV3/CR78 | A user who opens the wallet client cannot determine whether a wallet was ever registered on this device once the wallet deletion process has been completed
OBPPV3/CR79 | A user who re-installs the wallet client cannot determine whether the app was previously installed from within the application itself
OBPPV3/CR80 | When the application is installed, all application metadata is initialized in such a way that it cannot be distinguished from an application that has been used extensively<br><br> _An application can achieve this, for example, by initializing application metadata with random data that is indistinguishable from encrypted data_
OBPPV3/CR81 | New transactions signed by the wallet client are introduced to the Bitcoin P2P network using one node/API selected at random from a list of nodes/APIs once per transaction
OBPPV3/CR82 | New transactions signed by the wallet client are introduced to the Bitcoin P2P network using one node/API that is used by more than one wallet provider for pushing transactions to the network

OBPPV3/CR91 | When creating new versions of RBF transactions, the client does not modify transaction output values from previous versions
OBPPV3/CR120 | Before applying a software update, the client notifies the user of the udpate and provides an opportunity to intervene before wallet private keys or meta data are decrypted using updated software
OBPPV3/CR121 | Developers cryptographically sign all application binaries (or source code for interpreted languages) provided, and the client can verify the signature before private keys or wallet metadata are decrypted using updated software

OBPPV3/CR140 | A non-zero percentage of transactions broadcast over a network by the wallet client do not originate from the user<br><br> _This criterion is measured based on the percentage. This behavior is typically demonstrated by full node clients connected directly to the Bitcoin P2P network_
OBPPV3/CR150 | The client uses a secure ECDH protocol to derive payment addresses that are unpredictable to parties other than the transaction participant
OBPPV3/CR151 | The client does not share the same BIP32 extended public key for the purposes of key derivation between multiple transaction participants
OBPPV3/CR152 | The client derives a unique payment address for each transaction participant using random data, an address derived from a secret parent public key, or a hardened address derived from a known parent public key
OBPPV3/CR160 | The wallet client uses a pinned X509 certificate or public key for transport encryption of traffic
OBPPV3/CR161 | The wallet client uses a pre-shared symmetric key to authenticate the server
